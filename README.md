# LSB-Steganography
Encodes a given image with a message using least significant bit steganography

max_size must be the same in both encode.py and decode.py
it is the max number of bits for the length of the message

encode.py - change the input file to any image and it will output the encoded image to encoded.png
decode.py - takes in the decoded.png and prints out the encoded message
